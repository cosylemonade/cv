        <p><em>Information Technology Specialist</em></p>
        <p>
            I have been a technology enthusiast since I was very young and my
            parents puchased and Commodore 64. I remember studying and coding in
            basic for hours and writing my own text based games.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for problem solving has only increased with time. Today,
            I have over a decade of professional IT experience over several
            disciplines. I have worked as the solitary member of an IT environment to
            a supporting member of a team of 50 plus individuals working on a single
            project.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a special passion for educating those who struggle
            with technology and helping people realize their potential with tools
            that are readily available to all.
