        <h1>Deacon Mosley</h1>
        <p><em>Information Technology Specialist</em></p>
        <p>
            I have been a technology enthusiast since I was very young and my
            parents puchased a Commodore 64. I remember studying and coding in
            basic for hours to make a single pixel move across the screen or 
			write my own text based games.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2007, I graduated from OSU's Institute of Technology with a 
            Bachelor of Technology in Information Assurance and Foresics and 
            an Associate of Science in Information Technology and today I have over 
            13 years of professional experience. I have been responsible for an 
            entire organization as well as the member of a large team serving 
            as a single stakeholer in a large project. This has given me a very
            broad skillset and experience working both individually and with
            a team working to bring a large project to fruition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working with so many individuals with varying levels of technical 
            knowledge has taught me how to communicate what I do effectively. 
            While the problem solving of what I do itself brings instant 
            gratification, the real icing on the cake is customer satisfaction.
            I do my very best to meet others where they are. Technology should 
            make things better and easier and not be a source of frustration. 
            It is incredibly satisfying to bring understanding and help 
            make someone's job or day to day life more efficient.
